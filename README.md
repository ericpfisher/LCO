Loaner Checkout System

This is a back-of-house system used to manage IT repair loaners rather than using pen and paper.  The system was designed to be a web-interface, accessible from technician terminals.  The system is built using PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript/jQuery.

LCO is my first webapp project...EVER.
