Loaner Checkout Systen

This is a back-of-house system used to manage IT repair loaners rather than using pen and paper.  The system was designed to be a web-interface, accessible from technician terminals.  The system is built using PHP, MySQL, and elements of JavaScript.

A lot of my code was inspired by Jason Lengstorf's "PHP for Absolute Beginners."  If there are any similarities in my PHP/MySQL code that resemble snippets from his book, it's because that book was my launchpad for learning and using PHP on this scale. :)

Also, any codeblocks not generated by my own fingers will have a comment listing the location I found it.
